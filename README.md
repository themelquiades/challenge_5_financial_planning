5th weekly challenge, focused on creating tools to visualize savings and forecast performance of retirement portfolios.

The first section of this analysis allows users to visualize their savings and determine if they have enough assets to contribute to an emergency fund. It looks at the user's current portfolio compared to their emergency needs and returns a statement letting them know how they're doing.

The second section uses Monte Carlo analysis to forecast the performance of a 60/40 portfolio over 30 years and a 80/20 portfolio over 10 years.

All data was pulled in using Alpaca API calls to the Alpaca SDK.
